I put my headphones on,\nrunning my fingers over the black and white plastic keys, pressing a\nfew, letting a messy melody slip out, before I sit back, close my\neyes, and picture the ocean. Bluish green with fish swimming and\nbright sea plants. I jump in, and I\u2019m immersed by the water.\nThe familiar sense of peace rises inside and my hands stretch\ntowards the piano.\nAnd then I play.\n"

To get to\nthe top, she destroys whoever she needs to. Here, every moment is\ncrucial; there are no do-overs. One mistake can have you sent to the\nbottom of the food chain with the girls who have imaginary\nboyfriends and wear polyester un-ironically. It sounds dramatic, but\nthis is the way things are and the way they will always be.\nThe people at the top in high school get into the best colleges,\nget the best jobs, go on to run the country, and win Nobel prizes.\nThe rest end up with dead-end jobs, heart failure, and then have to\nstart an affair with their assistant to create some excitement in their\notherwise dull lives.\nAnd it\u2019s all because they weren\u2019t willing to put in the work to\nmake it in high school.\nMaintaining popularity at a place like Niveus is not about how\nmany friends you have. It\u2019s about looking the part, having the best\ngrades and dating the right people. You have to make everyone wish\nthey were you, wish they had your life. I know to an outsider, it\n"

I\u2019ve watched girls fawn all\nover him and I\u2019ve listened to him drone on about his hypothetical\nperfect girlfriend, waiting for the moment he turns my way and\nrealizes that his perfect girl could be me. And it\u2019s been frustrating;\nI\u2019m not usually afraid of making the first move when it comes to the\nguys I date, but, with Jamie, it feels different.\nMost boys are so predictable. I see right through them: their\nwants, desires, what makes them tick. My first boyfriend was a guy\nnamed Georgie Westerfield. He was the usual type girls like: tall,\nblond and the great-great-great-grandson of the guy who owns\nWesterfield Socks \u2013 so in short, swimming in billions of dollars. Most\nimportantly for me as a freshman though, was that he was a junior\nand every girl wanted him. Being Georgie\u2019s girlfriend got me noticed,\ntook me from being the invisible, unimportant, miserable girl I was\nin middle school. When I joined Niveus, I knew I wanted to make\nmyself everything that I hadn\u2019t been. And being Georgie\u2019s girlfriend\nnot only made me someone people wanted to know, but someone\nthey wanted to be.\nI discovered it wasn\u2019t hard to get close to Georgie; one, Jamie\nwas his friend and mentee through football and two, Georgie liked\nthat I was \u201cdifferent\u201d \u2013 meaning me being Black made him look cool.\nI ignored that, as I knew there was only so long I could fake being\ninto someone like Georgie anyway, and so I got to be Chiamaka, the\ngirl who got the guy everyone wanted, and then the first to break\nhis heart and move on to dating the next golden boy of Niveus.\nI always study them before I strike. Their social currency. Each\nboy bringing something new. Georgie got me noticed and Scotty, the\nboy next door with ins to so many social circles, made me more\nlikeable. Jamie is the only guy I\u2019ve actually liked as a friend, the only\none I didn\u2019t secretly hate. The only one who feels long term. It\u2019s\nhard to read someone like Jamie, though. We may be best friends,\nbut I swear\u2026most days I have no idea what that boy is thinking.\nWhich is why I decided to wait, let him make the first move.\nAnd like always, my plan worked.\n"

We\u2019d both\ngotten really drunk, so drunk I don\u2019t remember much of that night.\nBut I do remember how Jamie finally looked at me and saw us as\nsomething more than platonic. He\u2019d smiled down at me, tucked a\npiece of my hair behind my ear, and asked if I wanted to go upstairs.\nAnd I said yes. He told me to meet him in his bedroom, and\nwhile that night we only made out, it was the catalyst for what\nhappened the rest of the year. Jamie sneaking kisses, whispering\nthings in my ear, asking me to come over\u2026\nI\u2019m not na\u00efve enough to think hooking up with someone means\nthey like you. Things are just different between Jamie and me. I\ncatch him looking at me sometimes, trying to rile me up on purpose,\nsmiling widely whenever he succeeds. He makes me laugh\u2026looks at\nme like I\u2019m special.\nI\u2019ve spent the past three years building myself up to be the most\npopular girl at school, the girl who has it all, wanting to secure the\nperfect ending to my time at Niveus. And now that I\u2019m Senior Head\nPrefect, all I need are the final pieces: the Snowflake Crown, a Yale\nacceptance letter, and Jamie.\nI feel a nudge from Ava, who sits next to me in English class.\nSometimes we poke fun at the conspiracies our teacher, Mrs\nHawthorne, comes up with. Like the time she told us F. Scott\nFitzgerald was really the reincarnation of William Shakespeare. To\nwhich Ava had said \u201cand I\u2019m the reincarnation of Jane Austen\u2019s\narsehole\u201d. I\u2019d laughed so hard Mrs Hawthorne had threatened to\nseparate us. I admit, class is more entertaining with Ava around.\nPerhaps if hierarchies weren\u2019t so important and people weren\u2019t\nconstantly trying to take me down, maybe I\u2019d be more trusting of\npeople, and Ava and I would be more than just two girls using each\nother to survive high school. But the reality is, Niveus will always be\nNiveus. Besides, I didn\u2019t invent this twisted system that pits us\nagainst each other and makes us do crappy things for status \u2013 but I\ndo know how to play it.\n"

They\nmight come in handy someday.\nI put my head down, moving as fast as I can towards the drama\ndepartment. The drama kids usually hang out behind the stage there\n\u2013 in Crombie Auditorium, named after another rich donor. Crombie is\nmy best shot at finding Scotty, seeing as I don\u2019t know his schedule\nby heart like I used to in freshman year. A few weeks before we\nstarted dating, when I still thought of him as the cute white guy who\nplayed the trumpet at the back of the school band, I learned his\nentire schedule, including where he went before and after classes. I\nwanted to make sure I kept bumping into him \u201cby accident\u201d.\nLater, after a toxic year-long relationship from the end of\nfreshman year to the beginning of junior year, and a lot of tears and\nheartbreak, I used my knowledge of his schedule to avoid him as\nmuch as I could when things \u2013 us \u2013 didn\u2019t work out. And so, I hardly\never venture here any more. I even forgot how big Crombie is. Then\nagain, everything in this school is unnecessarily huge.\nI climb the steps of the spacious dark oak stage, slipping through\na gap in the thick green curtains to find a circle of students on the\nother side. They\u2019re all seated on black metal chairs with white scripts\nin their laps. Apart from one girl who looks at me with an offended\nexpression, no one else even glances my way. It\u2019s a weird change\nfrom the hallway earlier.\n\u201cThis is a closed practice,\u201d the girl says, her plaid skirt the only\nitem fitting the school\u2019s rule book. The rest of her is drenched in\nblack \u2013 black leather jacket, black fishnet tights, black band T-shirt,\nblack boots. The first day of school is the only time everyone follows\nthe dress code. After that it becomes more of a suggestion than an\nenforced rule. I guess this is one of the many things you can get\naway with at Niveus, but I\u2019ve never had the money to customize my\nuniform past the beat-up Vans I wear most of the time.\n"

That\nwas always my role. The best friend who pretends.\nBut this year I will get everything I want, and Belle will soon be a\nthing of the past.

To get to the\nother slide\u2014\u201d\nMy first instinct is to grab the heaviest object I can find and lob it\nat Jamie, but instead I interrupt with a dry laugh.

I press pause on the film, wanting their full attention before\nstarting it, and move back into my place next to Jamie.\n\u201cYou have a nice home cinema,\u201d Belle says. I can\u2019t read her face\nlike I can read Ruby\u2019s and Ava\u2019s. Is she mocking me or something?\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I reply without looking at her, my mind more focused\non trying to see if the room is secretly ugly. This room is my safe\nspace away from the loudness of the world. I sit here for hours\nsometimes, watching movies alone in the dark, clearing my head.\nMom and Dad had this built for me years ago and I decorated it\nmyself. The ceiling is black and filled with dozens of lights. It kind of\nlooks like stars in the universe, which is what I was going for.\nThere\u2019s a soft grey carpet and there are three rows of armchair-sized\ncinema seats.\nI like this room and if Belle doesn\u2019t she can leave, the door is\nthat way\u2014\n\u201cYou know, Chi used to have a massive Winnie-the-Pooh teddy,\nbut threw it out because it clashed with the persona she was going\nfor in sophomore year,\u201d Jamie says.\n\u201cOh yeah? What persona was that?\u201d Belle asks.\n"

First there was Headmaster Collins\u2019s resignation, then there\nwas everyone apparently knowing Jamie and Belle were a thing, and\nnow, Aces.

I notice Scotty\nsitting at the end, twirling the pasta with one hand while texting\nwith the other. I\u2019m surprised to see him here; he usually hangs\naround the drama kids.\nI wonder who he\u2019s texting.\nAnother reason I prefer eating lunch alone with Jamie is because\nthe jock table is always so loud, filled with what are meant to be\ngrown men in blue letterman jackets flinging food at each other.\nI catch up to Jamie, wanting to tell him that Belle clearly seems\nbusy eating vomit.

The Ace of Spades.\nI look around the hallway as the crowd thins. I think the first\nwarning bell has already gone off. Turning the card back round, I see\nthe edge of a word peeking out from behind the USB. I rip off the\nflash drive, revealing a handwritten message.\nEverything is on here \u2013 Aces\nThe second warning bell startles me, and I throw the USB and\ncard into my blazer pocket, before grabbing my sheets and book,\nand heading to registration.\nAs soon as the bell rings for lunch, I head to the library, an internal\nchain of what-ifs swirling through my thoughts as I quickly grab a\nfree computer. I switch it on, then plug the USB in. The library is\nsemi-crowded, with students mostly sitting around tables in the\ncentre or getting on with their own work. Even though I picked a\nseat in the corner where no one can see my screen, I worry that\nsomeone somewhere is watching me, because they always seem to\nbe lately. Who knows what might be on here?\n"

I took some pictures,\u201d I say,\nshowing Terrell.\nHe looks at my phone, eyebrows bunched up, expression\ngrowing more and more pissed.\n\u201cHave you told anyone?\u201d he asks, tearing his eyes away from the\nscreen and looking at me. I look down quickly, picking imaginary lint\nfrom my pants, trying not to make eye contact with him.\n\u201cI told Mr Taylor, my music teacher, today. He said he\u2019s gonna\nhelp us find out who put the posters up.

The mission tomorrow, how scared I\nam, how my future is hanging in the balance.\n"

What I saw told me that Niveus\nitself is somehow at the centre of this all, but Chiamaka wasn\u2019t\nanswering her phone and I needed to tell her. I should have told her\nand left, taking her with me.\nInstead of using my common sense, I found myself wandering\noff to music class, like a zombie. I even saw Daniel. He\u2019d smiled his\nbig handsome smile at me, but all I could see was his name on that\nlist, and him pretending to be nice to me but ruining my life behind\nmy back.\nI can\u2019t \u201cact normal\u201d when I know something really fucked up and\ndangerous is going on. I shouldn\u2019t have listened to her. I shouldn\u2019t\nhave stayed.\nThe wrinkles on Mr Taylor\u2019s face bunch up on his forehead. \u201cI\nwas once in high school too. Kids can be horrible, so I can imagine\nwhat you\u2019re going through.\u201d Something in his eyes changes, it\u2019s a\nsmall flicker but I notice it. Sympathy, I want to say, but it feels like\nsomething different. \u201cEspecially with college applications coming up,\nI know how stressful it can be,\u201d he finishes.\nI nod. \u201cJuilliard is the only thing keeping me sane right now.\u201d\nThis piece is coming together \u2013 kind of. I think Terrell was right\nabout the drums. The drums will definitely make it better, but then\nwhat if it\u2019s still not good enough?\nI look up at Mr Taylor, who is looking at me with a smile on his\nface. I\u2019m not sure why.\n\u201cYou\u2019re applying to Juilliard?\u201d he asks. Which is so strange,\nbecause, obviously. He and I discussed it at length at the end of\njunior year.

I\u2019m wearing one of his Superman shirts and sweats.\nChiamaka told her parents that she\u2019s okay and she\u2019s staying at a\nfriend\u2019s. She\u2019s now wearing a plaid PJ set Terrell apparently owns\neven though I\u2019ve never seen him wear anything so normal \u2013 other\nthan his outfit from earlier tonight.\nWe all sit in the fort talking about tonight \u2013 the protestors and\nthe fire and the shady journalist.

We are writing to\nwarn and advise you against sending Rhys to this school, as Pollards\nPrivate Academy systematically targets its Black students, practising\na form of social eugenics. Attached to this letter is evidence dating\nback to 1965, when the first case of social eugenics took place at\nthe now-closed institution, Niveus Private Academy, tragically costing\nthe first Black victim there her life, as detailed in the documents.\nFrom 1965, the school caused undue trauma to all enrolled Black\nstudents, including, but not limited to, emotional and physical\nharassment and severe mental trauma as well as attempts to\nsabotage academic records, college applications and employment\npossibilities.\nTo guarantee your son\u2019s protection from having a similar\nexperience at Pollards, we would love to invite him to join the Ruby\nBridges Academy. This is a school set up by The Underground\nSociety \u2013 a society founded to tackle the systemic inequality in\nschools across the country.\nNiveus was not the only institution practising social eugenics, and\nwe are still working to find those connected to Niveus, while also\nproviding an alternative solution for students we identify as being\ntargets of any of these institutions. Our aim is to reform all the\nsystems, starting with education.\n"

And if I can wake up every day to Terrell\u2019s face and\nma doing her puzzles, I think that would be everything to me.\n\u201cGonna go to the doctor\u2019s, Ma,\u201d I tell her, hugging her from\nbehind, before kissing her forehead.\n\u201cIs Terrell awake yet?\u201d\nI nod. \u201cI told him you made breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cHave a nice trip,\u201d she says.\nI leave, rushing out the front door, down the steps of our home\nand straight into my car.\nIt doesn\u2019t take me long to get to the hospital, where I walk past\nthe receptionist \u2013 much to her obvious dislike \u2013 up the stairs and\nstraight to her office, with her name on a plate outside the chestnut-\ncoloured door.\nI knock and she yells \u201cCome in\u201d and so I open the doors to find\nher behind her desk, sifting through papers. She throws me a quick\nglance and I smile, moving towards her and hugging her from\nbehind.\n\u201cRichards, unless your heart is failing, you need to wait in line.\u201d\n"

Like our ancestors did.\nI think about how many Black spirits have been killed by white\nsupremacy and lies. How many of us were experiments. Worthless\nbodies in some game.\nI think about Henrietta Lacks, whose body they used, mistreated,\nand tossed away but who changed medicine for ever. Who never got\nher revenge for the way they stole her cells, as if they were entitled\nto her body. Because she was Black and a woman, and in that\ncombination, she, to them, meant nothing.\nTo me, she and all the other spirits broken by this world and its\nsystems, are the reason I get up and do this every day.\nI walk into the room.\nThere he is, my final patient. Face hollow and sickly. Green and\nblue veins all over his arms and neck. Lying back, eyes peering up at\nme.\nHe\u2019s dying.\nI close the door behind me and I smile.\n"
